# blurrypwn - a webkit exploit

## **How did i discover it?**
I was testing out the new features of backdrop-filter.
And a person I know told me there is better perfomance when having multiple elements with backdrop-filter rather than one with less blur, now obviously I knew that was incorrect but I needed to prove him wrong... And it turns out he was joking ;(
Wasted time I thought until I found my devices were starting to become slow.

Then I tested it and found out how it works.

If anybody else has discovered I don't mean to take the credit for discovering this first.
And the name I came up with, but again, if this exploit already has been published before then just go that ones name unless your using my code.


# I will be adding more here soon!
